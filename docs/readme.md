# Product Operating Playbook
**Our Ethos**\
A great product doesn’t just work, ***it helps someone move forward***, with less friction, more clarity, and deeper trust. Our craft is not just engineering; ***it’s enabling progress.***

**Our Practice**\
We build for people who are trying to make progress, not for ourselves. We use Personas to stay human, and JTBD to stay purposeful.

**Content**\
A lite-weight product operating model that explains how product decisions are made using personas and Jobs-to-Be-Done so engineering always knows the why behind the work.
