<details>
<summary><strong>#1 — Start with Real Problems, Not Assumptions</strong></summary>

Everything begins with understanding the ***context and pressures in which people operate.***

***Practice***<br  />
Keep discovery honest and design intentional, ask:
- “Who is this for?”
- “What progress are they trying to make?”
- “What’s blocking that progress right now?”

***Relation***<br  />
Personas help us visualize real-world roles, environments, and behaviors — they give the work a human anchor.
JTBD defines the progress someone is trying to make, rather than the task they’re doing.

<summary><strong>#2 — Measure Progress Through Outcomes, Not Output</strong></summary>

Every product exists to help someone move from a **current state** (struggle, inefficiency, uncertainty)
to a **desired state** (confidence, control, simplicity).

***Shipping a feature isn’t success — enabling progress is.***

***Practice***<br  />
Define success through **outcomes**, such as:
- Faster reconciliation
- Fewer manual steps
- Better decisions
- Greater trust

Measure those — ***not lines of code or story points.***

***Relation***<br  />
Use personas to predict how different people define “better,” and test whether your product truly delivers that improvement.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>#3 — Keep Motivation at the Center</strong></summary>

People don’t just use products — ***they choose them***, often for emotional or social reasons as much as functional ones.

***Practice***<br  />
In design ask: “Why would someone choose this?”
If the answer isn’t tied to a clear motivation, you’re likely solving the wrong problem.

***Relation***<br  />
Personas highlight motivators such as ***ambition, confidence, recognition, trust, or safety.***
JTBD helps you articulate them:

> When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>#4 — Seek Progress, Not Perfection</strong></summary>

Progress happens in loops — ***learn, build, test, refine.***

***Practice***<br  />
Iterate fast. Validate early. Let learning shape your roadmap more than assumptions.

***Relation***<br  />
JTBD frames product work as a continuous journey; people struggle, explore, adopt, evaluate, and sometimes switch.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>#5 — Find and Fix Friction</strong></summary>

Every moment of friction, confusion, delay, workarounds, or resistance ***signals unmet needs.***

***Practice***<br  />
Instrument, observe, and ask:
> “Where are people struggling? What is this friction telling us about their deeper goal?”

***Relation***<br  />
Personas help us spot where struggles appear. JTBD clarifies why they happen and what progress people are failing to make.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>#6 — Build Shared Understanding</strong></summary>

Great products emerge when ***everyone shares the same mental model*** — of who the product is for, what they’re trying to do, and why it matters.

***Practice***<br  />
Use personas and job statements as shorthand in standups, planning, and retros — not as documentation, but as ***language for alignment.***

***Relation***<br  />
Personas provide a **human reference point**; JTBD provides a ***purpose-driven structure.***
Together, they align everyone on what “value” truly means.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>#7 — Balance Innovation with Trust</strong></summary>

Innovation only matters if it ***earns trust***.

***Practice***<br  />
Design for both innovation and assurance.
If you change behavior, show that it’s reliable and verifiable.

***Relation***<br  />
Personas remind us that ***reliability, compliance, and predictability*** aren’t “boring” — they enable confidence.
JTBD frames this as part of the job to be done: people want progress that feels safe.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>#8 — Simplify Relentlessly</strong></summary>

The clearer we are about what someone is trying to accomplish, the simpler the product becomes.

***Simplicity is not minimalism — it’s clarity.***

***Practice***<br  />
When evaluating a design or architecture, ask:
> “Does this make the core job easier, or just add more to manage?”

***Relation***<br  />
JTBD helps strip away everything that doesn’t serve the job.
Personas remind us which complexities are real — and which are self-inflicted.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>#9 — Stay Curious, Stay Close</strong></summary>

Stay close to users, customers, and data to ***keep your understanding fresh and grounded.***

***Practice***<br  />
Observe. Interview. Shadow. Use feedback cycles to challenge what you think you know.

***Relation***<br  />
Personas and jobs are not artifacts to be filed away — they evolve as real people and the business domain evolve.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>#10 — Validate with Evidence</strong></summary>

The final test of product work is whether it ***helps someone make progress better than before.***

***Practice***<br  />
Validate early and often. Ask: “Did this help them do their job faster, safer, or with more confidence?” If not — learn and adjust.

***Relation***<br  />
Personas and JTBD both demand validation — qualitative (stories, feedback) and quantitative (metrics, adoption).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>In Closing — Our Ethos</strong></summary>

A great product doesn’t just work — ***it helps someone move forward*** with less friction, more clarity, and deeper trust.
Our craft is not just engineering; ***it’s enabling progress.***

***Practice***<br  />
We build for people who are trying to make progress — not for ourselves.

***Relation***<br  />
We use Personas to stay human, and JTBD to stay purposeful.
