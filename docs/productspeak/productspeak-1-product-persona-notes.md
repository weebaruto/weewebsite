# Product Speak #1 – Product Persona Notes

<details>
<summary><strong>Product Persona – What</strong></summary>

- A product persona (or “user persona”) is a fictional archetype representing a segment of your real users: their behaviors, goals, attitudes, and responsibilities.
- Although personas are “imagined,” they should be grounded in user research and real data (interviews, analytics, surveys) rather than guesswork.
- Personas typically include: background, motivations, goals, pain points, usage context, and perhaps a quote/illustrative scenario.
- Personas differ from market segmentation: while segments are statistical clusters, personas are narrative, humanized profiles built from those clusters.
- The concept was popularized by Alan Cooper (in the early 80’s).

<summary><strong>Product Persona – Why</strong></summary>

**Empathy & Shared Understanding**
Personas help teams see real people behind data points. They foster empathy and prevent designing purely from internal assumptions or “what I’d want.”

**Focus & Prioritization**
With personas, you can prioritize features and capabilities that matter most to key user types rather than trying to please a vague “everyone.”

**Alignment Across Teams**
Personas provide a shared reference for product, design, marketing, and development teams, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

**Better Decision Making & Validation**
They provide a lens for evaluating features, UX flows, and messaging:
“Does this serve Persona A’s needs or create friction?”

**Prevent “Designing for Yourself”**
Without personas, stakeholders may each imagine different users (or design for themselves). Personas anchor decisions to data.

**Communication & Storytelling**
Personas help you tell the “story” of your product through relatable scenarios.

<summary><strong>Product Persona – How</strong></summary>

**1️⃣ Research & Data Collection**
- Conduct user interviews / usability tests
- Survey users or prospects
- Analyze analytics / usage logs
- Study support tickets, feedback, real customer stories
- Identify patterns and clusters of behavior / needs

**2️⃣ Distill Behavior & Goals**
- Look for recurring goals, pain points, and usage contexts
- Focus on what the user is trying to achieve and why
- Group similar users into candidate segments

**3️⃣ Draft Personas**
- For each segment: name, bio, goals, pain points, context
- Add visuals (photo or avatar) to aid memory
- Use a memorable nickname
- Include a quote aligned with their profile

**4️⃣ Validate & Iterate**
- Share personas with stakeholders / real users
- Compare against new user research
- Merge, split, or retire personas as necessary

**5️⃣ Operationalize & Embed**
- Make personas visible (posters, shared docs)
- Use personas explicitly in design & decision points
- Use them in usability testing scripts, feature reviews, backlog prioritization
- Revisit and refresh personas periodically

<summary><strong>Product Persona – Dos & Don’ts</strong></summary>

**Do**
- Use real data, not guesswork
- Involve cross-functional members
- Use personas actively in day-to-day decisions

**Don’t**
- Overemphasize style over substance
- Create too many personas (3–5 is often enough)
- Let personas become “shelfware” — revisit regularly

<summary><strong>Product Persona – Instructional Template</strong></summary>

**Profile**</br>
**Purpose**: Establish who this person is — their role, environment, characteristics.</br>
**Think about**:
- What is their role, job title, or main responsibility?
- What type of organization or context do they work or operate in (e.g., startup, enterprise, education, healthcare)?
- How much experience or expertise do they have in their field?
- What are their daily tasks and challenges?
How comfortable are they with technology or change?
- What are their core traits or attitudes (analytical, creative, pragmatic, etc.)?
Creating a user quote that aligns with their profile

**Tips**: Keep it professional and behavioral — focus on what influences how they use products, not irrelevant personal details. Use a memorable nick-name for the persona e.g. "Owner Olivia”

---

**Motivations**</br>
**Purpose:** Reveal why this person engages with your product or category.</br>
**Think about**:
- What problems or ambitions are pushing them to act?
- What would make their work or life easier, faster, more rewarding, or more successful?
- What motivates them — efficiency, recognition, mastery, convenience, creativity, control, cost-savings?
- What emotions or values influence their choices (trust, status, curiosity, security, etc.)?

**Tips**: Write motivations as short, human-sounding statements:

---

**Goals**</br>
**Purpose:** Define measurable outcomes.</br>
**Think about**:
- What are their key objectives in their job or daily life?
- How would they define success when using your product or a similar one?
- What specific improvements are they hoping for (speed, output, quality, cost)?
- How do these goals connect to broader business or personal results?

**Tips**: Phrase goals as outcomes, not tasks

---

**Frustrations**<br>
