# Product Speak
***TL;DR*** - A series of educational and awareness sessions highlighting the concepts and practices for “putting product at the center of operations” i.e. a [Product Operating Model](../../readme.md) (POM).

**Purpose**
- To suggest and educate teams on what a product operating model looks like.
- To align around shared principles, language, and practices.
- To provide resources that can be referenced during onboarding, training, and ongoing product development.
- To inspire a shift from output-driven feature delivery toward outcome-driven product management.


**Guiding Principle** - The job of a product operating model and a practising team is not to deliver features; it’s to deliver outcomes.
