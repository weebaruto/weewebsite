<summary><strong>Product Persona - What</strong></summary>

- Fictional archetype representing a segment of real users & behaviours
- Although personas are “imagined,” they should be grounded in real data
- Personas typically include: background, motivations, goals, pain points
- Differ from market segmentation: statistical vs. narrative
- The concept was popularized by ***Alan Cooper***.

<summary><strong>Product Persona - How</strong></summary>

**1 Research & Data Collection**
- Conduct user interviews, surveys, analyze analytics, feedback
- Identity patterns and clusters of behavior / needs

**2 Distill Behavior & Goals**
- Look for recurring goals, pain points, what the user is trying to achieve
- Group similar users into candidate segments

**3 Draft Personas**
- For each segment, produce a persona: name, bio, goals, pain points, context
- Add visuals (photo or avatar) to aid memory, use a memorable nickname

**4 Validate & Iterate**
- Share personas with stakeholders / real users
- Merge, split, or retire personas as necessary

**5 Operationalize & Embed**
- Make personas visible (e.g. posters, shared documents)
- Integrate into day-2-day, decision points, feature reviews, prioritization

![Owner Olivia](../personas/images/owner-olivia.png)</br>
**Bio:** - Establish who this person is - their role, environment, and characteristics - to ground the persona in reality. </br>

>“If my service breaks, everything stops. I need fast, clear visibility — without becoming an observability expert.”

Owner Olivia is a Service / Application Owner working in a fast-paced, distributed engineering organization. She owns the reliability and operational health of one or more customer-facing services. While she has strong engineering fundamentals, she is not a specialist in SRE or observability and values tools that are simple, standardized, and opinionated. </br>

**Motivations:** Reveal why this person engages with your product or category — the underlying drivers behind their decisions. </br>
- Deliver reliable, resilient services that meet customer expectations </br>
- Reduce time spent firefighting incidents and debugging blind spots </br>
- Gain actionable visibility into their service without heavy tooling overhead </br>
- Operate with confidence during releases </br>
- Remove toil via standardised, self-service observability </br></br>

**Goals:** Define what this persona ultimately wants to achieve — measurable or observable outcomes. </br>
- Instrument their service easily using OpenTelemetry (minimal learning curve) </br>
- Detect issues before customers notice through unified telemetry </br>
- Achieve fast root-cause analysis using correlated logs, metrics, and traces </br>
- Maintain clear ownership boundaries and accountability </br>
- Reduce MTTR and improve reliability posture </br></br>

**Frustrations:** Identify what blocks or frustrates them — the barriers that prevent them from reaching their goals </br>
- Disjointed dashboards and inconsistent instrumentation </br>
- Missing or incomplete telemetry during incidents </br>
- High learning curve for observability tools and vendors </br>
- Noise-heavy alerts with limited actionability </br>
- Manual toil: repeated config, copy-paste dashboards </br></br>

**Success:** Clarify how this persona measures success — signals they care about. </br>
- Reduction in Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) </br>
- % of services fully instrumented with OTel (auto + manual) </br>
- Error budget adherence and reliability trending up </br>
- Incident frequency trending downward </br>
- Faster incident reviews with clear dashboards and traceability </br>
