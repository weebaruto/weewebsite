# Reliability Ravi - JTBD Canvas

| **Component** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Job Statement (Core JTBD)** | ***When*** ensuring reliability across distributed systems,<br  /> ***I want to*** maintain high-quality, consistent, and actionable telemetry across all services,<br  /> ***so I can*** detect issues early, reduce on-call load, and uphold reliability at scale. |
| **Functional Jobs** | • Standardize instrumentation across teams<br  />• Maintain reliable OTel pipelines and collectors<br  />• Correlate logs, metrics & traces across services<br  />• Detect anomalies and failure patterns quickly<br  />• Ensure SLOs, SLIs, alert policies are meaningful<br  />• Reduce operational toil via automation<br  />• Provide reliability guidance to engineering teams |
| **Emotional Jobs** | • Feel confident in service reliability during on-call<br  />• Stay calm under pressure with trustworthy signals<br  />• Avoid firefighting caused by missing or broken telemetry |
| **Social Jobs** | • Be recognized as a reliability authority<br  />• Demonstrate operational excellence to leadership<br  />• Enable teams to follow best practices without friction |
| **Pain Points / Struggling Moments** | • Missing or inconsistent telemetry from teams<br  />• Fragmented toolchains and dashboards<br  />• High alert noise, low signal clarity<br  />• Manual configuration of observability components<br  />• Lack of cross-service dependency insights<br  />• Time lost triaging preventable issues |
| **Desired Outcomes** | • High signal-to-noise telemetry<br  />• Reliable, scalable ingestion pipelines<br  />• Faster incident diagnosis through correlation<br  />• Reduction in toil and manual setup<br  />• Clear visibility into systemic reliability risks |
| **Success Metrics** | • Reduction in MTTR and MTTD<br  />• % of services with validated OTel instrumentation<br  />• Alert noise reduction<br  />• Pipeline uptime and throughput stability<br  />• Reduction in repeated incident patterns<br  />• Improved on-call satisfaction |
| **Drivers** | • Growing service complexity<br  />• Organizational need for reliability and operational maturity<br  />• Increasing cost of incidents and outages |
| **Constraints** | • Limited team bandwidth<br  />• Inconsistent adoption of standards<br  />• Varied engineering maturity across teams<br  />• Legacy tools and fragmented environments |
| **Opportunity Areas** | • Automated instrumentation validation<br  />• SLO/SLI templates and health models<br  />• Cross-service dependency maps<br  />• Standardized alerting and runbook integration<br  />• Collector configuration automation<br  />• Reliability insights and early-warning detection |
