# Owner Oliva - JTBD Statements

## Master JTBD Statement
***When*** owning and operating a customer-facing service in production,***I want to*** have clear, unified, and trustworthy observability into how my service behaves,***so I can*** detect issues early, resolve incidents quickly, and confidently deliver a reliable user experience.

## JTBD-1: Instrument My Service Reliably
***When*** setting up telemetry for my service,***I want to*** instrument logs, metrics, and traces with minimal effort and complexity,***so I can*** ensure consistent visibility without becoming an observability expert.

---

## JTBD-2: Detect and Diagnose Issues Quickly
***When*** my service begins to degrade or fail,***I want to*** understand what’s happening and why using correlated signals,***so I can*** restore service health quickly and reduce customer impact.

---

## JTBD-3: Operate Against Clear SLOs

## JTBD-4: Reduce Operational Toil
***When*** managing observability workflows (alerts, dashboards, instrumentation),***I want to*** avoid repetitive manual setup,***so I can*** focus more time on product delivery and less on operational overhead.

---

## JTBD-5: Understand Dependencies and Impact
***When*** investigating issues in a distributed system,***I want to*** see how my service interacts with others,***so I can*** identify upstream/downstream causes and collaborate effectively during incidents.
