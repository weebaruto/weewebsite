# JTBD Canvas — [Builder Bella](../../personas/persona-builder-bella.md)

| **Component** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Job Statement (Core JTBD)** | ***When*** building and deploying new features in a distributed service,<br  /> ***I want to*** instrument my code easily and understand its runtime behaviour,<br  /> ***so I can*** ship quickly, debug efficiently, and avoid production surprises. |
| **Functional Jobs** | • Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation with minimal complexity<br  />• Understand performance and errors introduced by new code<br  />• Validate that telemetry is flowing and complete<br  />• Reproduce and debug customer issues faster<br  />• Adopt consistent patterns for logs, metrics, and traces<br  />• Use templates and tooling to avoid repetitive setup |
| **Emotional Jobs** | • Feel confident shipping code without fear of breakage<br  />• Reduce stress during debugging and performance investigations<br  />• Avoid feeling overwhelmed by tooling complexity |
| **Social Jobs** | • Demonstrate engineering excellence to peers and leads<br  />• Collaborate smoothly with SREs and service owners<br  />• Contribute clean, observable services to the wider system |
| **Pain Points / Struggling Moments** | • High learning curve for observability tools<br  />• Inconsistent or missing telemetry in services<br  />• No clear examples or templates for instrumentation<br  />• Noisy or overwhelming debugging experience<br  />• Dashboard + alert fragmentation<br  />• Manual, repetitive setup for instrumentation and dashboards |
| **Desired Outcomes** | • Reliable instrumentation by default<br  />• Faster debugging and issue resolution<br  />• Clear visibility into how new code behaves<br  />• Standardized patterns across teams<br  />• Reduced reliance on SREs for support |
| **Success Metrics** | • Reduction in code-to-production time<br  />• Time saved on debugging and instrumentation<br  />• % of services instrumented with standard templates<br  />• Fewer production regressions<br  />• Increased adoption of OTel SDKs and platform tooling |
| **Drivers** | • Pressure to ship quickly<br  />• Need for reliable, maintainable services<br  />• Growing complexity of microservices and distributed traces |
| **Constraints** | • Limited observability expertise<br  />• Fragmented ecosystem of tools<br  />• Limited time to learn new systems<br  />• Inconsistent guidance across teams |
| **Opportunity Areas** | • Auto-instrumentation defaults<br  />• Language-specific OTel starter kits and example repos<br  />• Development-time instrumentation validation<br  />• Debugger + trace integration<br  />• Pre-built dashboards and alert templates<br  />• Clear signal naming conventions and best-practice patterns |
