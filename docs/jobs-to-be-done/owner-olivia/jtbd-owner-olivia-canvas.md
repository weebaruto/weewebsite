# JTBD Canvas — [Owner Olivia](../../personas/persona-owner-olivia.md)

| **Component** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Job Statement (Core JTBD)** | ***When*** owning and operating a customer-facing service in production,<br  /> ***I want to*** gain reliable, unified, and actionable observability into my service’s behaviour,<br  /> ***so I can*** detect issues early, resolve incidents quickly, and confidently deliver a resilient experience to users. |
| **Functional Jobs** | • Instrument services easily using OpenTelemetry<br  />• Gain unified visibility across logs, metrics, and traces<br  />• Diagnose performance degradations and failures quickly<br  />• Establish and monitor SLOs/SLIs<br  />• Understand service dependencies and cross-service impact<br  />• Support incident response with clear, actionable insights<br  />• Reduce operational toil and manual setup |
| **Emotional Jobs** | • Feel confident that my service is healthy and reliable<br  />• Reduce stress during incidents through clear, trusted telemetry<br  />• Avoid fear of deploying changes without visibility |
| **Social Jobs** | • Demonstrate operational maturity to leadership and SRE teams<br  />• Earn trust from peers by being a reliable service owner<br  />• Show that my team follows best practices in engineering excellence |
| **Pain Points / Struggling Moments** | • Missing or inconsistent instrumentation<br  />• Dashboard and alert sprawl across multiple tools<br  />• Slow incident triage due to poor context<br  />• High learning curve for observability tooling<br  />• Difficulty defining meaningful SLOs<br  />• Manual, repetitive setup for telemetry and dashboards |
| **Desired Outcomes** | • Reliable, correlated telemetry signals<br  />• Fast, accurate root-cause identification<br  />• Clear SLO/SLA performance visibility<br  />• Reduced incident frequency and MTTR<br  />• Simplified instrumentation and onboarding<br  />• Lower operational overhead |
| **Success Metrics** | • MTTR / MTTD reduction<br  />• % of services fully instrumented with OTel<br  />• Reduction in alert noise<br  />• SLO adherence and error budget usage<br  />• Incident frequency trends<br  />• Time saved on debugging and setup |
| **Drivers** | • Growing service complexity and distributed architectures<br  />• Increasing customer expectations for reliability<br  />• Pressure to ship faster without harming stability |
| **Constraints** | • Limited observability expertise<br  />• Fragmented tooling ecosystems<br  />• Time constraints due to product delivery<br  />• Dependency on platform/SRE teams for guidance |
| **Opportunity Areas** | • Unified observability platform<br  />• Automated OTel instrumentation and setup<br  />• SLO templates and guided workflows<br  />• Cross-service dependency visualisation<br  />• Standardised dashboards and alerts<br  />• Incident-focused insights and timeline stitching |
