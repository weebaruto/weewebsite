# Getting Started
**Our Ethos**\
A great product doesn’t just work, ***it helps someone move forward***, with less friction, more clarity, and deeper trust. Our craft is not just engineering; ***it’s enabling progress.***

**Our Practice**\
We build for people who are trying to make progress, not for ourselves. We use Personas to stay human, and Jobs-To-Be-Done to stay purposeful.

**Enable Progress**\
By following our lite-weight product operating model to deliver a product which aspires to "***outcomes over outputs***"

1. Clone this repository and start building out your own product artifacts and enabling progress.
2. Create your core Product Personas - [Training](./docs/productspeak/productspeak-1-product-persona.md) and [Examples](./docs/personas/readme.md)
3. Create your Jobs-To-Be-Done Statements & "One-Pager" Canvas - [Training](./docs/productspeak/productspeak-2-jobs-to-be-done.md) and [Examples](./docs/jobs-to-be-done/readme.md)
4. Iterate through Discovery Cycles, Creating and Logging Decisions - [Training](./docs/productspeak/productspeak-4-product-discovery.md) and [Examples](./docs/discovery/readme.md)
5. Iterate through Delivery Cycles, Creating & Delivering Features - [Training](./docs/productspeak/productspeak-5-product-rhythm.md) and [Examples](./docs/issues/feature.md)
<br  />

**Tracking & Reporting**\
Leveraging custom form templates for [Discovery](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/discovery.yml) and [Feature](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.yml) Issues provides us with traceability and reporting against Product Personas, Jobs-To-Be-Done, Discovery Decisions and Feature Deliveries; As shown, in the following example for "[Owner Olivia](./docs/issues/)"

>Remember to be practicing your [product manifesto](./docs/productspeak/productspeak-3-product-manifesto.md) ***in all your affairs***!
