# Example Persona
***TL;DR*** - Example Product Persona artifacts (and a template to follow) based on the introduction of a Foundational Observability Platform powered by OpenTelemetry.

**Purpose**\
Introduction to the concept of [Product Persona](../productspeak/productspeak-1-product-persona-notes.md), how they help us know who our customers are, but also why they turn to our products and services; they give context (who the user is) and intent (why they act)

What You’ll Find Here:
- "[Owner Olivia](./persona-owner-olivia.md)" - End-to-end owner of a customer-facing service who needs clarity, simplicity, and reliability.
- "[Builder Bella](./persona-builder-bella.md)" - Everyday software engineer who benefits from frictionless tooling, clear conventions, and fast feedback.
- "[Reliability Ravi](./persona-reliability-ravi.md)" - Power user of the Platform — responsible for reliability, incident response, and operational excellence.
