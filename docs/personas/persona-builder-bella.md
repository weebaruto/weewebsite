## 🎯 Motivations

- Ship features quickly and with confidence
- Minimize time spent on debugging and operational overhead
- Reuse shared tooling and templates instead of reinventing solutions
- Ensure code is instrumented correctly *without* deep observability expertise
- Improve collaboration with SREs and service owners

---

## 🏆 Goals

- Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation easily
- Understand how code behaves in production
- Reduce time spent diagnosing performance issues
- Adopt best practices for logs, metrics, and traces
- Build reliable, maintainable services that avoid production surprises

---

## 😣 Frustrations

- High cognitive load from multiple observability tools
- Inconsistent or missing telemetry across services
- Lack of clear examples or templates for instrumentation
- Debugging in production is noisy and time‑consuming
- Manual dashboard creation and alert setup
- Confusion around which signals actually matter

---

## 📈 Measures of Success

- Faster debugging and issue identification
- Reduced code-to-production time
- % of services instrumented by default
- Higher adoption of platform standards and libraries
- Reduced dependency on SREs for incident analysis
- Fewer regressions and production issues traced back to poor instrumentation

---

> **Summary:**
> Bella represents the everyday software engineer who benefits from frictionless tooling, clear conventions, and fast feedback. A strong Observability Platform allows her to understand system behaviour, ship features confidently, and minimize time lost to operational issues.
